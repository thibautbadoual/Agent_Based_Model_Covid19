# ME233_Project / Stanford University

- Modeled the spread of COVID-19 on campus using an agent-based model to investigate how the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals are influenced by policies surrounding (which student spaces are safest to re-open first, how testing frequency can minimize further infection, and how differences in mask and social distancing protocol depending on the space can affect infection rates) 
- This model changes recovery rate, quarantine rate, contact rate, and infectious period. 
- Concluded that opening up different campus zones is feasible AS LONG AS there is a corresponding increase in testing frequency
